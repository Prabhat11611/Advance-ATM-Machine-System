# Advance-ATM-Machine-System
It is an Advance ATM Machine System where the admin and the customer both can interact with the ATM in completely different different way.
This project is completely based on Python Programming and MySQL.
Here "pip_atm_first_page_connection" is the main file which needs to be run first and after that the rest other 2 files will catch up with this file.
The operations for the customer are: withdraw, deposite, check_balance, change PIN, and exit. Similarly, the operations available for Admin are: insert new data such as Customer Name, Aadhar Card Number, PIN. and also the Admin can update the data such as : Name of the Customer,ATM Number, ATM PIN, Add Balance.
